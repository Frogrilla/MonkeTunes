# MonkeTunes
A custom music loader for Gorilla Tag that uses unity web requests to grab music from a folder. </br>
(The mod does not come with any music and does not distribute any copyrighted material)

## Use:
To use this mod, simply add .OGG files to the music folder in the MonkeTunes plugin folder. Then, use either the in world computer that goes to your current map or use Computer Interface to control the mod. 

I should add that pressing option 1 on the music list will toggle playing and the arrows on the music computer are to switch the play mode.
